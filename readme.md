> **⚠ Warning**<br> skiftOS is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for daily use. Please do not use it in production environments. Here be dragons! 🐉

**SkiftOS** is an open-source operating system built from the ground up with a focus on modularity, simplicity, and modern design principles.  Driven by a dissatisfaction with the fragmented user experiences prevalent in contemporary operating systems, SkiftOS strives for deep integration and a cohesive aesthetic. This project is a labor of love—an artistic pursuit rather than a commercial product.


## Key Features

- [**Karm**](src/libs): A modern C++ core library providing foundational building blocks.
- [**KarmUI**](src/libs/karm-ui/): A reactive UI framework for building elegant user interfaces.
- [**Hideo**](src/apps): A beautiful desktop environment prioritizing intuitive design.
- [**Hjert**](src/kernel): A capability-based "pragmatic" microkernel.
- [**CuteKit**](https://codeberg.org/cute-engineering/cutekit): A versatile build system and package manager designed for cross-compilation and complex project management.
- [**Vaev**](src/web): A browser engine built for speed, accuracy, and simplicity.

## Core Philosophy

- **Modularity**: Components are designed to be as self-contained as possible, encouraging customization and experimentation.
- **Simplicity**: Skift favors clear solutions over complexity, aiming for a system that is understandable and maintainable.
- **Modernity**: Skift leverages cutting-edge C++ practices and technologies for safety, readability, and efficiency.
