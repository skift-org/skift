**SkiftOS** is a hobbyist operating system built from the ground up with a focus on modularity, simplicity, and modern design principles.  Driven by a dissatisfaction with the fragmented user experiences prevalent in contemporary operating systems, SkiftOS strives for deep integration and a cohesive aesthetic. This project is a labor of love—an artistic pursuit rather than a commercial product.


## Key Features

- **Karm**: A modern C++ core library providing foundational building blocks.
- **KarmUI**: A reactive UI framework for building elegant user interfaces.
- **Hideo**: A beautiful desktop environment prioritizing intuitive design.
- **Hjert**: A capability-based "pragmatic" microkernel.
- **CuteKit**: A versatile build system and package manager designed for cross-compilation and complex project management.
- **Vaev**: A browser engine built for speed, accuracy, and simplicity.

## Core Philosophy

- **Modularity**: Components are designed to be as self-contained as possible, encouraging customization and experimentation.
- **Simplicity**: Skift favors clear solutions over complexity, aiming for a system that is understandable and maintainable.
- **Modernity**: Skift leverages cutting-edge C++ practices and technologies for safety, readability, and efficiency.
